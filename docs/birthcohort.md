# Birth-cohort effects in overdose and opioid analgesic use
Birth age cohort effects are based on groups of people of the same age having a similar experience/risk to each other.

We have observed median age of overdose death in the US to have incresed about 10 years over the last decade, with some changes [specifically in age of heroin overdose](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.10.005) over time. We suspect that the similar effects may be worth exploring for patients with painful conditions who receive opioids.

## Previous work

This topic was [examined in 2010 by Silvia Martins](https://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsad.2010.71.480). They used two nationally represented self-reported samples.

> **Objective:** This study aims to test whether recent increases in the reported prevalence of opioid-use disorder in the United States occurred across all age groups (period effect), consistently only among younger age groups (age effect), or varied according to year of birth (cohort effects).<br>
**Method:** Joint analysis of data from the 1991-1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES) and the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), focusing on individuals ages 18-57, grouped by 10-year age intervals. Sample sizes for the present analyses were 30,846 for the NLAES and 31,397 for the NESARC. Prevalence of lifetime and past-year prescription opioid-use disorder resulting from nonmedical use (abuse and dependence) was examined.<br>
**Results:** Within birth cohorts, prevalence of lifetime prescription opioid-use disorder increased during the 10 years between surveys, indicating the importance of age effects. In addition, lifetime and past-year prevalence of prescription opioid-use disorder was higher among more recent birth cohorts as compared with earlier birth cohorts, indicating the importance of cohort effects. Consistent with a period effect, cross-cohort comparisons showed that risk for prescription opioid-use disorder has increased for all individuals regardless of their birth cohort membership from the NLAES to the NESARC survey.<br>
**Conclusions:** Findings suggest that more problems (abuse and dependence) may emerge as prescription opioid users get older and that more recent birth cohorts are at higher risk for prescription opioid problems.

A similar phenomenon was observed with crack cocaine [Golub](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854894021004002) and other drugs [Mannes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13607863.2018.1430740).

## Methods

Others have pointed out [measurement issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3469580/) in birth cohort analyses. There is a [great tutorial](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/age-period-cohort-analysis) from Columbia Public health that walks us through how to conduct this type of analysis, and [advanced methods](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158538).
