# Overdose studies of new medication
*Causal epidemiology considerations and solutions for studies evaluating impact of Rx drugs in preventing overdose*

We want to draw legitimate conclusions about what causes overdoses. We use data sources from electronic health records, insurance claims, vital statistics, and elsewhere to answer fundamental questions about the safety of new medications. But we know that these data sources are imperfect, and that not everything is documented in them with certainty.

*So how do we know whether what we are seeing is real?*

## Technical Overview
Longitudinal data necessitate accounting for time-varying exposures and confounding to fall within a causal framework. As new ADFs come to market, patients may be switched between ADFs or comparators, creating methodological complications. We are evaluating the relative importance of applying advanced epidemiologic methods in claims-based studies similar to those found in post-marketing requirements. To accomplish this, we will first use claims-linked-mortality-data to ascertain whether ADF patients have different risk profiles than non-ADF opioid patients. Then, we will apply statistical methods to account for time-varying and other forms of confounding.

## Scope of the Problem

|Issue|Description|Status & Resources|
|---|---|---|
| **Cohort effect**  |   |   |
| **Chanelling**  |   |   |
| **Early adopter prescribers**  |   |   |
| **Death vs. disenrollment**  | Research using insurance claims data allow for a comprehensive nationwide assessment of opioid prescribing patterns and downstream effects. However without linkage to death data, disenrollment from the database is treated as a censoring event, as patients are lost to follow-up. Our preliminary analyses show that 27.6% of individuals who “disenroll” from the Medicare Supplemental plan have a death date within 30 days of disenrollment.  | **In progress**<br>[Study details](https://www.opioiddata.org/studies/predicting-out-of-hospital-death/)<br>[Preliminary analysis]()  |
