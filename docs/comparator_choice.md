This document contains information on comparator choice in research of abuse-deterrent formulations (ADF) of opioids.

What is the best comparator for an ADF? Is it other medicines with the same active ingredient? Or, would it be better to consider a patient pool of similar patients as the comparator?

Considerations in comparator selection are discussed at length in [D'Arcy et al 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30666285/)

### Active Comparators

Active comparators are drugs (or drug class) that have similar indication and formulation as the treatment. Studies with active comparators restrict to patients initating treatment with medications that have similar indications, and thus have less potential for confounding than studies that make use of inactive comparators or studies that use non-initators as the comparison group (D'Arcy et al 2018).

### Inactive Comparators

Inactive comparators are drugs (or drug class) that are not indicated/used for the same purpose at the treatment of interest. Inactive comparators should have no known association with the outcome.
